It includes 5 GB of high-speed data, unlimited calls, 1000 SMS per month, and after he uses up the 5 GB, the speed drops to 128 Kbps. He doesn't get any roaming either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ravi's usage is 12 GB of data each month, which is way more than the 5 GB his plan offers. That explains why he's getting overage charges. He's also making 800 calls and sending 500 SMS, which is within the limits of his current plan since it offers unlimited calls and 1000 SMS. So, his main issue is the data overage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's asking if there's a better plan for heavy data users. Looking at the available plans, the Unlimited Plan seems like a good fit. It offers truly unlimited data with a fair usage policy after 50 GB, which is much more than Ravi's current usage. It also includes unlimited calls and SMS, which he's already using but within the limits. The speed after the limit is 1 Mbps, which is better than his current 128 Kbps. Plus, it has 5G access, cloud storage, and hotspot features, which could be beneficial for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Premium Plan is another option, but it's more expensive and offers similar features to the Unlimited Plan, just with a higher data cap and international calls. Since Ravi is mainly concerned about data overage, the Unlimited Plan should suffice and is more cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",

Ryan is on the Data-Only Plan, which costs between $15 to $25 a month. It includes 10 to 20 GB of high-speed data, but no calls or SMS. After the limit, the speed drops to 512 Kbps, and it supports tethering and hotspots. He's using a Motorola Edge on a 5G network and joined recently in February 2024. He had a recent issue with SIM activation, but that's been addressed.\n",

      "Next, I need to explain how the plan addresses his query. Since he's asking about his plan, the response should cover all the features he's getting. I should mention the data allowance, speed after limit, and the fact that it's data-only without calls or SMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering if an upgrade is appropriate. Ryan is on the Data-Only Plan, which is the most basic. His usage might be light, but if he needs more data or additional features like calls and SMS, an upgrade could be beneficial. The Premium Plan offers unlimited high-speed data, international calls, priority support, and streaming perks. It's a significant step up and might be a good suggestion if Ryan's needs are growing beyond just data.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should present the upgrade suggestion in a helpful, not pushy way. Since he's not on a top-tier plan, it's appropriate to suggest the Premium Plan. I'll explain the benefits clearly, making sure he understands how it could enhance his experience.\n",
